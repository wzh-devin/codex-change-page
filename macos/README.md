# Codex Dream Skin Studio

Unofficial macOS theme studio for the **official Codex Desktop** app.

Turn an image you like into a Codex theme: a dedicated home banner, a low-noise task background, and frosted content layers — while **keeping native sidebar, suggestion cards, project picker, task content, menus, and composer** fully interactive.

This project injects through **local loopback CDP**. It does **not** modify the official `.app`, `app.asar`, or code signature.

> Not affiliated with OpenAI. Codex is a trademark of its respective owners.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (`arm64`)
- macOS 13 or newer for the graphical manager
- Official Codex Desktop installed and launched at least once (`~/.codex/config.toml` exists)
- No global Node.js install required (uses Codex’s signed bundled Node after validation)

## Recommended: Codex 换肤助手

The Electron manager provides guided installation, theme creation, a theme library,
diagnostics, menu-bar shortcuts, restore, engine uninstall, and safe `.codexskin`
import/export.

Build the arm64 test DMG:

```bash
cd app
pnpm install
pnpm package:mac
pnpm verify:package
```

Open `app/release/Codex-Change-Page-1.2.0-arm64.dmg`, drag **Codex 换肤助手**
to Applications, then right-click Open for the first ad-hoc-signed test launch.

The first-run wizard performs:

1. macOS / arm64 / Codex signature and runtime inspection.
2. Versioned Engine installation and selective appearance backup.
3. Bundled-theme or personal-image selection.
4. Explicit confirmation before launching or restarting Codex with loopback CDP.

The app keeps the compatible runtime paths:

| Item | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Engine | `~/.codex/codex-dream-skin-studio` |
| State / logs / themes | `~/Library/Application Support/CodexDreamSkinStudio` |
| App preferences | `~/Library/Application Support/Codex 换肤助手` |

Use **恢复与卸载 → 恢复官方外观** to stop the injector, restore the saved
appearance values, close the debug session, and restart Codex normally.

## Legacy script workflow

```bash
# 1) Optional static checks (needs Codex.app present for bundled Node path)
./tests/run-tests.sh

# 2) Install to the stable path and create Desktop launchers
./scripts/install-dream-skin-macos.sh --no-launch

# 3) Customize with your image (Finder picker if you omit flags)
~/.codex/codex-dream-skin-studio/scripts/customize-theme-macos.sh

# 4) Start / re-apply, verify, or restore via Desktop:
#    Codex Dream Skin.command
#    Codex Dream Skin - Customize.command
#    Codex Dream Skin - Verify.command
#    Codex Dream Skin - Restore.command

# 5) Optional: menu bar (SwiftBar) — apply / pause / change image
./Install\ Menu\ Bar.command
# Look for 🎨 Skin in the top-right menu bar
```

Legacy install location after step 2:

| Item | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Engine | `~/.codex/codex-dream-skin-studio` |
| State / logs / user images | `~/Library/Application Support/CodexDreamSkinStudio` |
| Theme backup | under Application Support (`theme-backup.json`) |

## Customer ZIP (optional packaging)

The ZIP workflow remains available as a compatibility package. New deliveries should
prefer the DMG manager.

```bash
./scripts/build-client-release.sh "$HOME/Desktop/Codex 主题编辑器.zip"
```

That ZIP contains a visible installer plus a hidden `.codex-dream-skin-studio` engine. Do not ship only CSS/images.

## How it works (security boundary)

1. Discover `com.openai.codex` and validate signature / Team ID / arch / bundled Node.
2. Start Codex via user `launchd` with CDP bound to `127.0.0.1` only.
3. Accept the debug port only when it belongs to Codex (or a legitimate child).
4. Inject only into expected `app://` renderer targets.
5. Keep a small injector alive across reloads and route changes.
6. Restore stops the injector only when PID, path, and start time match the recorded job.

CDP is powerful and unauthenticated on loopback. Prefer Restore when you are done theming.

## Image guidelines

- PNG / JPEG / HEIC / TIFF / WebP (macOS readable)
- Source ≤ 50 MB; prepared file ≤ 16 MB
- Wide images work best (width ≥ 2000 px recommended)
- Keep the left side relatively calm for native home titles
- Image is banner + background only — never a full-window fake UI overlay

CLI example:

```bash
~/.codex/codex-dream-skin-studio/scripts/customize-theme-macos.sh \
  --image "/path/to/image.png" \
  --name "My theme" \
  --accent "#7cff46" \
  --secondary "#36d7e8" \
  --highlight "#642a8c"
```

Reset to the bundled abstract demo:

```bash
~/.codex/codex-dream-skin-studio/scripts/customize-theme-macos.sh --reset-demo
```

## What this is not

- Not an OpenAI product and not a fork of Codex source
- Not a way to patch or rebrand the official binary
- Not a Windows build (see `../windows/`)
- Not an API proxy: theming does not change model providers or API keys

If you use a third-party API relay, configure it separately — keep theme install and API config as two explicit steps.
