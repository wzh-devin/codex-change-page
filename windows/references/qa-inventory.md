# QA inventory

## User-visible claims

1. The home screen visibly matches the reference mood: one cropped pink-purple starry hero, Fiona portrait crop, signature/brand treatment, native Codex suggestion cards, polaroid, and skinned native composer.
2. The sidebar is blush glass rather than merely changing the accent color.
3. All real Codex controls remain interactive; the skin is not a screenshot overlay.
4. The skin survives route changes and renderer reloads while the injector daemon runs.
5. The official Store package and `app.asar` remain unchanged.
6. Restore removes the injected DOM/CSS and install/restore can be repeated.
7. Restore closes the saved CDP listener before reopening Codex normally.

## Functional checks

- Home feature card: click one card and confirm the real composer is populated or the normal action occurs.
- Project selector: click the real project chip under the "选择项目" label and confirm the native project menu opens.
- Sidebar: open a real task, then return to New Task.
- Composer: type text, verify caret/readability, then clear it without sending.
- Reload: use CDP `Page.reload`, wait, and confirm the injection marker returns.
- Restore/reapply cycle: remove live skin, verify marker absent, apply again, verify marker present.
- Update resilience: resolve the current `OpenAI.Codex` Appx location dynamically for launch. A versioned path saved for cleanup must be revalidated against the registered package full/family identity before any process is stopped.
- Restart consent: an existing normal Codex window is never force-closed without explicit CLI authorization or shortcut confirmation.
- Config safety: Chinese project names, LF/CRLF choice, quoted target keys, table-header comments, and unrelated TOML sections survive install/selective restore; ambiguous target shapes fail unchanged, exact recovery keeps a copy of the replaced current file, and install refuses both registered and state-recorded old Codex processes.

## Visual checks

- 1280x820 initial home: hero, four native cards, real project selector, and composer are all visible without horizontal scrolling.
- Narrower window: accept Codex's native responsive reduction to two or three suggestion cards; no essential control is covered and the polaroid may intentionally hide.
- Normal task: messages remain readable and composer does not overlap content.
- Inspect the sidebar, header, hero edges, card labels, composer controls, scrollbar, ribbon, and bottom-right decoration.
- Reject black/transparent sidebar artifacts, clipped cards, duplicated/disconnected project labels, rasterized native controls, weak contrast, or decorations intercepting clicks.

## Exploratory checks

- Start when the debug port is occupied: fail with a clear message or use a caller-selected port.
- Start after Codex updates: package discovery and injection still work without patching installed files.
- Tamper `state.json` with a reused PID and confirm cleanup does not stop that process, archives the stale state, and continues safely.
- Serve a fake `app://` CDP target or remote/mismatched WebSocket URL and confirm both launcher and injector reject it. Reuse the port with a new Browser ID and confirm the existing watcher exits without reconnecting.
- Force verification failure and confirm the injector, state file, and newly launched debug session are rolled back.
- Start two operations concurrently and confirm the second fails clearly without changing config, state, or processes.
- Close Codex without restore and confirm the Browser identity anchor closes and the watcher exits without reconnecting or rapidly growing logs.

## Automated checks

- `tests/run-tests.ps1`: strict UTF-8/no-BOM writes, UTF-16 rejection, LF/CRLF preservation, concurrent-write detection, exact backup/recovery, `[desktop]`-scoped restore, ambiguous TOML rejection, non-ASCII paths, Appx/state identity, argument quoting, payload construction, Browser ID, and loopback URL rejection.
- `node --check` for the injector and renderer payload.
- Live Windows signoff remains required for Store process ownership, restart consent, screenshot, and CDP closure.
